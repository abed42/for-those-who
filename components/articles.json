				"content": " \nIt is observed that LLMs often struggle to retrieve relevant information from the middle of long input contexts, exhibiting a “lost-in-the-middle” behavior. The research paper addresses the critical issue of the performance of large language models (LLMs) when handling longer-context inputs. Specifically, LLMs like GPT-3.5 Turbo and Mistral 7B often struggle with accurately retrieving information and maintaining reasoning capabilities across extensive textual data. This limitation hampers their effectiveness in tasks that require processing and reasoning over long passages, such as multi-document question answering (MDQA) and flexible length question answering (FLenQA).  \n \n \n \nCurrent methods to enhance the performance of LLMs in long-context settings typically involve finetuning on real-world datasets. However, these datasets often include outdated or irrelevant information, which can lead to hallucinations and other inaccuracies. Traditional datasets such as MDQA and FLenQA have shown that LLMs tend to exhibit a “lost-in-the-middle” behavior, where their performance is optimal at the beginning or end of the input context but deteriorates for information in the middle. \n \n \n \nA team of researchers from the University of Wisconsin-Madison proposes a novel finetuning approach utilizing a carefully designed synthetic dataset to address these challenges. This dataset comprises numerical key-value retrieval tasks designed to enhance the LLMs’ ability to handle long contexts more effectively. By using synthetic data that avoids the pitfalls of outdated or irrelevant information, the researchers aim to improve LLMs’ information retrieval and reasoning capabilities without introducing hallucinations. \n \n \n \nThe proposed synthetic dataset consists of simple dictionary key-value retrieval tasks, where each task involves multiple dictionaries with a few keys each. For instance, the dataset for Mistral 7B includes 350 samples, each containing 85 dictionaries, resulting in prompts with roughly 3900 tokens. Finetuning is conducted on the answer part of these tasks, masking out other elements to focus the model’s learning process. \n \n \n \nExperiments demonstrate that this approach significantly enhances the performance of LLMs in long-context tasks. For example, finetuning GPT-3.5 Turbo on the synthetic data resulted in a 10.5% improvement on the 20 documents MDQA benchmark at the tenth position. Moreover, this method mitigates the “lost-in-the-middle” phenomenon and reduces the primacy bias, leading to more accurate information retrieval across the entire input context. The performance of models finetuned on the synthetic data was compared against those finetuned on real-world datasets, with the synthetic approach showing superior results in maintaining consistent accuracy across different context positions.  \n \n \n \nThe study introduces an innovative approach to finetuning LLMs using synthetic data, significantly enhancing their performance in long-context settings. The proposed method demonstrates substantial improvements over traditional finetuning techniques by addressing the “lost-in-the-middle” phenomenon and reducing primacy bias. This research highlights the potential of synthetic datasets in overcoming the limitations of real-world data, paving the way for more effective and reliable LLMs in handling extensive textual information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCheck out the Paper.

				"content": "Ethereum (ETH) price has encountered a setback after briefly surpassing the $3,500 mark on Monday, dropping once again to the $3,400 support level on Tuesday. The delay stems from the expected full approval by the SEC for Ethereum ETF applications, which have now been postponed to July 8. \nSEC Requests Revised Filings \nAnalysts had initially anticipated approval by July 2, but the SEC has requested issuers to submit revised filings by July 8. Bloomberg ETF expert Erich Balchunas shared on social media that the SEC took additional time to provide feedback, resulting in a revised timeline. Balchunas stated:  \nUnfort think we gonna have to push back our over/under till after holiday. Sounds like SEC took extra time to get back to ppl this wk (altho again very light tweaks) and from what I hear next wk is dead bc holiday = July 8th the process resumes and soon after that they’ll launch \n \nSEC Chair Gary Gensler previously indicated that Ethereum ETFs would likely receive approval by “the end of the summer.” The SEC is currently reviewing and approving the S-1 forms, which represent the second step in launching spot Ethereum ETFs.  \nDespite the delay, asset managers remain optimistic about the SEC greenlighting the first US spot Ethereum ETF applications that directly invest in Ether, with expectations set for mid-July. A recent Bloomberg report highlighted the constructive dialogue between asset managers and the regulator. \nEthereum ETF Launch Inches Closer \nPer the report, the regulator’s feedback provided minor questions that issuers are currently addressing. In May, the SEC approved the proposal by exchanges to list these products, requiring a separate approval for their launch. \nSteve Kurz, head of asset management at Galaxy Digital, predicted the approval of an Ethereum ETF within the next couple of weeks. Galaxy Digital has filed for an Ether ETF, and Kurz expressed confidence in the process, emphasizing their familiarity with the requirements based on their experience with the Bitcoin ETF. \nSeveral prominent firms, including BlackRock Inc., Fidelity Investments, 21Shares, and Invesco, have filings awaiting approval. The disclosure of fees on the respective funds is a necessary step before trading commences. \nAssuming the funds receive a green light, one key question remains: Will Ether portfolios generate a similar level of demand as the historic debut of US spot-Bitcoin ETFs in January, which accumulated $52 billion in assets? \n $15 Billion In Inflows Within First 18 Months \nAs previously reported by NewsBTC, Ethereum ETFs may attract significant inflows in the first few months of trading, although they may not have the same volume of inflows as the newly approved Bitcoin ETF market.  \nIn a note to investors Bitwise’s Chief Investment Officer (CIO), Matt Hougan projected that these ETFs could see $15 billion in net inflows within their first 18 months of trading.  \nTo arrive at this estimate, Hougan considered the market capitalizations of Bitcoin and Ethereum, expecting investors to allocate to their respective exchange-traded products (ETPs) proportionally. \n \nHougan pointed out that US investors have already invested $56 billion in Spot Bitcoin ETPs, and he anticipates this figure to reach $100 billion or more by the end of 2025.  \nDrawing from this reference, he determined that Spot Ethereum ETFs would need to attract $35 billion in assets to match the Bitcoin ETFs, a process that could take around 18 months.  \nAdditionally, he noted that the Spot Ethereum ETFs would launch with $10 billion in assets, thanks to the conversion of the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into an ETF. \n \nAt the time of writing, ETH is trading at $3,418, recording significant losses in the monthly time frame amounting to over 9%.  \nFeatured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com ",

Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, predicts the Ethereum ETFs to go live by the 15th of July. \nGeraci stated that with the revised S-1 submission for Ethereum ETFs to happen in July, the final S-1 approval from the SEC could arrive around July 12. Thus, July 15, Monday, would be the most probable day to begin trading Ether ETFs. \n \nWen spot eth ETF? \nBBG sticking w/ mid-July. \nAmended S-1s due July 8th. \nPotential final S-1s by July 12th. \nWould theoretically mean launch week of July 15th. \nvia @emily_graffeo @olgakharif pic.twitter.com/NG8xhtCP21 \n— Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) July 3, 2024 \n \nIssuers to Address SEC Query On Spot Ethereum ETF \nLast Friday, the US SEC returned the S-1 filings to issuers to address some minor questions. Sources familiar with the matter stated that the issuers have been already working on it. As we know, in May, the SEC approved the 19b-4 filings to list the Ether ETFs on exchanges. However, they can only go live for trading after the SEC approves the S-1 submissions. \nSteve Kurz, head of asset management at Galaxy Digital, expected the Ether ETF approval in the next couple of weeks. Speaking to Bloomberg TV on Tuesday, July 2, Kurtz said: \n“This is window-dressing, the SEC is engaged. We’ve been doing this for months now. We did it for the Bitcoin ETF, the products are substantially similar — we know the plumbing, we know the process.” \nNow the bigger question in everyone’s mind is will the Ether ETF prove to be a strong catalyst to drive the crypto market higher? \nAlso Read: Why Are Ethereum Institutional Products Depleting Before ETF Launch? \nEthereum to Outperform Bitcoin \nOn Tuesday, K33 Research published a report stating that Ethereum would be outperforming Bitcoin post the ETF approval. As per K33, the launch of Ether ETfs would absorb nearly 0.75% to 1% of all ETH in circulation within the initial five months. This expectation is in line with that of Gemini which predicted $5 billion inflows within the first six months of launch. K33 senior analyst Vetle Lunde said: \n“ETFs are a solid catalyst for relative ETH strength as the summer progresses and flows accumulate, and I firmly view current ETH/BTC prices as a bargain for the patient trader.” \nThe ETH/BTC ratio steadily declined from 0.056 after the Bitcoin ETFs launched, reaching 0.046 by May 24. However, unexpected news that the SEC would soon approve Ethereum ETFs boosted the ratio back up to 0.055. \nAlso Read: ETH/BTC Price Prediction: ETF Hype, FOMO and Ethereum Price Imminent Rally To $5,000 \nThe post Spot Ethereum ETFs to Go Live on July 15, ETH Bull Run Ahead? appeared first on CoinGape.",

While the latest figures reveal a 1.27% decline in the past 24 hours, the staggering $20 billion trading volume over the same period suggests a significant undercurrent of activity. \nWhales, the large-scale Bitcoin holders, are rumoured to be accumulating, potentially signalling confidence in a year-end rally. This, coupled with Bitcoin’s resilience within an upward channel, paints an intriguing picture for price predictions. \nAs the market grapples with mixed economic signals from the US, the question arises: will Bitcoin price defy bearish trends and soar in the coming months? \nThe following analysis delves into the technical indicators and market sentiment surrounding Bitcoin’s potential trajectory, aiming to shed light on this captivating query. \nBitcoin Price Prediction \n \n \n \n \n \nBitcoin is currently trading at $61,985, down nearly 1.25% in the last 24 hours. Despite the minor decline, its market capitalization remains strong at $1,222 billion. \nThe cryptocurrency is currently finding support within an upward channel, with a critical level at $61,700. \nA break below this $61,700 support level could trigger further downward movement, potentially leading Bitcoin towards the $60,700 and $60,000 support levels. \nHowever, the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $62,210 is currently acting as resistance, suggesting that any upside momentum may be limited in the short term. \n \n \n \n \nBitcoin Price Prediction – Source: Tradingview \nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently sits at 48, indicating a neutral market sentiment. Neither overbought nor oversold conditions are present at this time. \nOverall, the technical outlook for Bitcoin suggests a pivotal moment. The $61,700 level is crucial, as a break below could accelerate a bearish trend. Investors are advised to closely monitor price action around this level. \nA potential trading strategy could involve buying above $61,700, targeting the $62,700 and $64,000 resistance levels, or selling below $61,700, aiming for the $60,700 and $60,000 support levels. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n            You might also like \n            Bitcoin Price Prediction 2024 – 2034 \n         \n99Bitcoins Presale Is Live!

				"content": "The upcoming launch of Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) around July 8 is expected to help Ethereum (ETH) perform better than Bitcoin (BTC) in the weeks after they start trading in the United States. \n \n \n \nAccording to K33 analysts Vetle Lunde and David Zimmerman, Bitcoin may face selling pressure as $8.5 billion worth of BTC is returned to creditors of the collapsed exchange Mt. Gox starting this week.  \n \n \n \n \nGovernments are selling into the summer, while open interest in ETH is surging towards record levels with the ETF launch drawing near.https://t.co/PdJIFeikbT— K33 Research (@K33Research) July 2, 2024 \n \n \n \n \nIn contrast, ETH has been underperforming against Bitcoin for over a year, despite Bitcoin’s market-leading gains driven by over $14 billion in flows to Bitcoin exchange-traded products this year. \n \n \n \nLunde and Zimmerman expect ETH to experience some initial turbulence following the ETF launch. However, they believe that inflows into the funds will likely boost ETH’s price over time.  \n \n \n \nLunde, said, “ETFs are a solid catalyst for relative ETH strength as the summer progresses and flows accumulate, and I firmly view current ETH/BTC prices as a bargain for the patient trader.”  \n \n \n \nThe analysts maintain a bullish outlook for ETH, anticipating net inflows of 0.75-1% of its circulating supply post-ETF launch, despite the market’s stubborn disagreement evidenced by Ether futures trading at a discount to Bitcoin futures and an ETH/BTC rate of 1 ETH to 0.055 BTC. \n \n \n \nAfter falling to a yearly low of 0.045 on May 24 due to a decline in value compared to Bitcoin over the past year, the price of Ether relative to Bitcoin rebounded quickly to its current value of 0.055 following the SEC’s sudden approval of Ether ETFs, as per CoinMarketCap data. \n \n \n \nLunde and Zimmerman noted that Ether futures open interest remains high, indicating that many traders are leveraging heavily to bet on ETH’s potential price movement leading up to the ETF launch.  \n \n \n \nThey believe the ETFs represent a golden opportunity for ETH to strengthen its position against Bitcoin in the market. \n \n \n \n \nAlso Read: VanEck Announces Fee Waivers for Spot Ethereum ETF \n",

				"content": " \nEnsuring the safety and moderation of user interactions with modern Language Models (LLMs) is a crucial challenge in AI. These models, if not properly safeguarded, can produce harmful content, fall victim to adversarial prompts (jailbreaks), and inadequately refuse inappropriate requests. Effective moderation tools are necessary to identify malicious intent, detect safety risks, and evaluate the refusal rate of models, thus maintaining trust and applicability in sensitive domains like healthcare, finance, and social media. \n \n \n \nExisting methods for moderating LLM interactions include tools like Llama-Guard and various other open-source moderation models. These tools typically focus on detecting harmful content and assessing safety in model responses. However, they have several limitations: they struggle to detect adversarial jailbreaks effectively, are less efficient in nuanced refusal detection, and often rely heavily on API-based solutions like GPT-4, which are costly and non-static. These methods also lack comprehensive training datasets that cover a wide range of risk categories, limiting their applicability and performance in real-world scenarios where adversarial and benign prompts are common. \n \n \n \nA team of researchers from the Allen Institute for AI, the University of Washington, and Seoul National University propose WILDGUARD, a novel, lightweight moderation tool designed to address the limitations of existing methods. WILDGUARD stands out by providing a comprehensive solution for identifying malicious prompts, detecting safety risks, and evaluating model refusal rates. The innovation lies in its construction of WILDGUARDMIX, a large-scale, balanced multi-task safety moderation dataset comprising 92,000 labeled examples. This dataset includes both direct and adversarial prompts paired with refusal and compliance responses, covering 13 risk categories. WILDGUARD’s approach leverages multi-task learning to enhance its moderation capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance in open-source safety moderation. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWILDGUARD’s technical backbone is its WILDGUARDMIX dataset, which consists of WILDGUARDTRAIN and WILDGUARDTEST subsets. WILDGUARDTRAIN includes 86,759 items from synthetic and real-world sources, covering vanilla and adversarial prompts. It also features a diverse mix of benign and harmful prompts with corresponding responses. WILDGUARDTEST is a high-quality, human-annotated evaluation set with 5,299 items. Key technical aspects include the use of various LLMs for generating responses, detailed filtering, and auditing processes to ensure data quality, and the employment of GPT-4 for labeling and generating complex responses to enhance classifier performance. \n \n \n \nWILDGUARD demonstrates superior performance across all moderation tasks, outshining existing open-source tools and often matching or exceeding GPT-4 in various benchmarks. Key metrics include up to 26.4% improvement in refusal detection and up to 3.9% improvement in prompt harmfulness identification. WILDGUARD achieves an F1 score of 94.7% in response harmfulness detection and 92.8% in refusal detection, significantly outperforming other models like Llama-Guard2 and Aegis-Guard. These results underscore WILDGUARD’s effectiveness and reliability in handling both adversarial and vanilla prompt scenarios, establishing it as a robust and highly efficient safety moderation tool. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn conclusion, WILDGUARD represents a significant advancement in LLM safety moderation, addressing critical challenges with a comprehensive, open-source solution. Contributions include the introduction of WILDGUARDMIX, a robust dataset for training and evaluation, and the development of WILDGUARD, a state-of-the-art moderation tool. This work has the potential to enhance the safety and trustworthiness of LLMs, paving the way for their broader application in sensitive and high-stakes domains. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCheck out the Paper.

				"content": "The potential that AI could unleash in diagnosing health conditions is huge. Credit: UN Geneva, Flickr, CC BY-NC-ND 2.0 \nArtificial Intelligence (AI) has been transforming the landscape of disease diagnosis lately with a truly unique and groundbreaking technique. This technique focuses on analyzing patterns of human voice as well as eye scans that could become a useful tool for further medical analysis by doctors around the world. \nThese revolutionary and cutting-edge technologies that are still in the works enable much earlier detection of various conditions that have plagued humanity for centuries. Such diseases even include life-threatening conditions and facilitate a much more personalized treatment plan and approach for patients. With the huge potential that is upon us and aims to improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs for governments and individuals alike, AI is promising to fundamentally revolutionize the way we approach disease diagnosis in the near future. \nHow AI analyzes voice for disease detection \nSome AI algorithms that have been focused on this field have the capacity to detect subtle changes in voice patterns linked to specific diseases. This is something the human ear could never do. \nSuch an example comes from a study published in late 2023 in the journal Mayo Clinic Proceedings: Digital Health. There, it is noted that a short voice recording of just six to 10 seconds can be used to determine with high accuracy whether someone has respiratory diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease, and mental health issues like depression and anxiety. \nConditions that make millions of people suffer, such as Parkinson’s, glottic cancer, and vocal fold paralysis can also be detected through voice analysis via new groundbreaking techniques similar to the one published by that recent study. Machine learning models are trained on very large datasets of voice recordings to identify unique “vocal biomarkers” that are somehow associated with each condition. This completely non-invasive and quite cost-effective screening method can help in very early diagnosis and intervention, aspects critical for the well-being of patients. \nAI-powered eye scans for early diagnosis \nIn addition to this groundbreaking voice analysis, AI is also making a series of other fascinating and significant steps in detecting the same or even other diseases using a different technique through eye scans. \nThis is done by analyzing thoroughly retinal images that the patient can take, with AI then identifying signs of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and even Alzheimer’s. This particular model is called RETFound and is enabled by INSIGHT, the Health Data Research Hub for Eye Health in the UK. Deep learning algorithms are currently being trained to recognize patterns and include abnormalities in retinal blood vessels that would enable earlier diagnosis before even the first symptoms become apparent to patients and doctors alike. This truly innovative technology has the vast potential to prevent serious issues such as vision loss and other complications associated with these widespread diseases. \n \nBenefits of AI disease diagnosis \nThe integration of AI in many disease diagnoses offers numerous benefits not limited to one field. Earlier detection, as is understandable, leads to better patient outcomes, as treatment can be initiated at a very early stage before the condition progresses with irreversible damage. \nAI also enables a much more personalized treatment plan that could be based on individual disease profiles. This would ensure that targeted and effective interventions take place in a timely manner. Moreover, AI-powered diagnosis can significantly reduce healthcare costs by preventing complications and hospitalizations that otherwise would have been inevitable. It also increases access to diagnostic services to many more people, particularly in underserved areas where specialist expertise may be limited and transportation is costly. \nChallenges and future developments \nWhile AI holds immense possibilities and promises nothing sort of miracles in disease diagnosis, there are obviously challenges that need to be addressed before such technological advancements become widely available. \nEnsuring the privacy and security of sensitive health data is of utmost importance, especially at a time when scammers are always ready for their next targets. Validating AI algorithms across truly diverse patient populations is also fundamentally crucial to ensure their reliability and generalizability. This would allow for the avoidance of unnecessary mistakes. \nAdditionally, seamless integration of AI into clinical workflows requires good levels of collaboration between technology developers and healthcare providers, as they are both equally necessary for the development of such tools. Last but not least, of course, is the fact that educating patients and healthcare professionals about the benefits and limitations of AI is also utterly important. Ongoing research that hasn’t yet concluded aims to expand the range of detectable diseases and improve the accuracy of AI algorithms. However, more research is necessary. \nThe future of AI in diagnosis \nAI has the huge potential to revolutionize disease diagnosis through voice and eye scans among other things. Truly non-invasive and cost-effective screening methods can help healthcare professionals achieve much earlier detection and offer personalized treatment plans. Such a development would ultimately improve patient outcomes and help thousands if not millions of people live longer, higher quality lives. \nRelated: EU AI Act: Did Europe Just Kill Its AI Development?",

				"content": "Fundstrat’s head of research, Tom Lee has doubled down on his initial Bitcoin prediction, strongly emphasizing that the pioneer cryptocurrency will surge to $150,000. The Wall Street strategist highlighted Bitcoin’s strong bullish outlook, believing that the cryptocurrency will eventually pull out of bearish trends soon. \nBitcoin To Hit $150,000 In 2024 \nIn a recent interview with CNBC Television, Lee expressed bullish optimism over Bitcoin’s future outlook, reaffirming his previous prediction that the cryptocurrency would reach new all-time highs of $150,000 by the end of 2024.  \n \nEarlier in May, Lee made a bullish forecast for Bitcoin, anticipating a dramatic surge to $150,000 before the year ends. At the time, the Fundstrat head of research attributed his ambitious forecast to the cooling down of inflation in the United States (US) and a subsequent increase in the demand for BTC. However, now Lee adds that BTC could witness a sharp rebound following the conclusion of Mt Gox’s Bitcoin repayment process to creditors. \nDuring the interview, Lee suggested that the upcoming Bitcoin redistribution by Mt Gox might be driving the bearish pressure on Bitcoin’s price. Earlier in June, Mt Gox disclosed that it would officially start its $9 billion worth of BTC and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) repayment plans in July. The redistribution will see creditors being refunded and compensated for the Bitcoin exchange’s hack attack in 2014.  \nWith $9 billion worth of BTC and BCH set to flood the market, speculations are rising concerning potential sell-offs from creditors. This sentiment has led to BTC’s downward spiral, triggering stronger selling pressures from investors.  \nBitcoin’s price also fell below $60,000 at some point, recording even more declines as miners sold off their holdings to purchase more effective mining tools. Lee believes that following any Gox’s repayment process, Bitcoin may have a “pretty sharp rebound” in the second half of the year.  \nBearish Trends May Be Over For BTC \nBitcoin price has successfully crossed the $60,000 threshold and is now trading at $62,523, as of writing. Since early June, the cryptocurrency has experienced a sharp downward trend, crashing by up to 20% due to the substantial outflows from Spot Bitcoin ETFs.  \nHowever, Bitcoin may be getting ready for a fresh upside as analysts foresee a major rebound as miners’ selling pressure cool off and the broader crypto market stabilizes. \n \nParticularly, on-chain market intelligence platform, CryptoQuant has projected a potential upside for Bitcoin in the third quarter of 2024 (Q3). Furthermore, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has expressed bullish sentiment for BTC’s price prospects.   \nIn an X (formerly Twitter) post, Martinez highlighted Bitcoin’s underperformance in the previous month, describing this bearish event as a “negative June.” Despite the downtrend, the analyst foresees a strong rebound for Bitcoin in July, with an average return of 7.98% and a possible price increase to $63,200 or $63,800.  \n",

However, she dismissed claims related to secondary sales of Balance Coin (BNB) as securities and argued that the commission should follow an American Legal Model. \n \n \n \nCoinbase, in its appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, cited the Binance ruling as a foundation for its argument that the SEC should initiate rulemaking to define the regulatory perimeter for digital assets more clearly.  \n \n \n \nLikewise, Ripple Labs submitted a “supplemental authority” in their case, stressing the need to outline the legal status of various types of sales of its XRP token and referring to Judge Jackson’s remarks on the disadvantage of making successive regulatory decisions. \n \n \n \nCoinbase is contesting claims it operated as an unregistered securities exchange, while Ripple has been involved in a multi-year lawsuit with the SEC over its sale of XRP, which the agency deems an unregistered security. \n \n \n \nThe crypto industry is keenly awaiting further developments in these cases, with a scheduling conference for the SEC’s case against Binance set for July 9. The decisions made in these cases can enhance the SEC’s position to push for transparent and consistent rules like Ripple and Coinbase.  \n \n \n \nDuring these legal proceedings, the demand for definite legal requirements seems to be the industry’s desire for stability within a clear legal setting. \n \n \n \n \nAlso read: U.S. Judge Rejects SEC’s Main Claims Against Binance \n",

The forecast is associated with the current presidential campaign and the participation of Joe Biden \n \n \n \n \nAsset Manager Standard Charterd @StanChart Geoffrey Kendrick updates his Bitcoin price prediction to $100k by US election – this is backed up by my chart predicting $107000 around US election late August early November timeframe.\"On Tuesday, Standard Chartered Bank's head of… pic.twitter.com/20pkI95ubM— MartyParty (@martypartymusic) July 2, 2024 \n \n \n \n \nAccording to Kendrick, a scenario where Trump wins could be highly favourable for Bitcoin claiming that Trump’s policies could improve the regulatory and mining environment for cryptocurrencies.  The former president has been supporting the crypto space, for instance, he has accepted campaign contributions in BTC and has sat down with industry stand-ins. \n \n \n \nKendrick has outlined potential market movements should Biden withdraw from the race, yet pivotal. Should Biden step down, Kendrick suggests that Bitcoin could temporarily dip to between $50,000 and $55,000.  \n \n \n \nThis forecast hinges on the registration deadline of August 4, as per Ohio law, which will confirm the Democratic nominee’s status. However, at the time of writing Bitcoin was trading at $62,185.23 a slight decline of 1.08 % in 24 hours  \n \n \n \nKendrick argues that, if Biden stays in the race, this will be a good buying opportunity in Bitcoin with strong growth throughout the election period. On the other hand, a replacement by a strong Democratic candidate like Michelle Obama could keep the Bitcoin prices subdued.  \n \n \n \nHowever, Kendrick has set positive long-term expectations of $200,000 by 2025, which shows high expectations for Bitcoin’s performance \n \n \n \n \nAlso read: Michael Dell’s BTC Poll on X Grabs Michael Saylor’s Attention \n",

I am pretty sure that I am going with a hybrid approach, take out about 10-15% to keep going, then just Hold the rest.

				"content": " \nAs the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, investors are always on the lookout for the next big opportunity. Reaching the $1 mark is a significant milestone for any cryptocurrency, symbolizing a level of growth and stability that can attract even more investment.  \n \n \n \nIn this article, we highlight five cryptocurrencies that are prime candidates to reach $1 soon. Among them, BlockDAG (BDAG) stands out with its innovative technology and robust growth potential. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1. BlockDAG (BDAG): The Technological Marvel Ready to Soar \n \n \n \nBlockDAG is a rising star in the crypto world, leveraging its unique Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) architecture to offer unparalleled scalability and transaction speed. Unlike traditional blockchains, BlockDAG’s structure allows for the simultaneous processing of multiple transactions, significantly enhancing throughput and reducing latency. This efficiency, combined with a hybrid Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, ensures robust security, making it a standout in the crowded crypto market.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBlockDAG’s recent presale success, raising over $55 million, showcases strong investor confidence and hints at its potential to reach $1 soon. The project’s strategic roadmap, continuous development updates, and active community engagement further bolster its growth prospects. With a mainnet launch on the horizon and integration with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), BlockDAG is well-positioned to attract a broader audience and achieve significant price appreciation. \n \n \n \n2. Dogecoin: The Meme Coin with Real Potential \n \n \n \nDogecoin started as a joke but has evolved into a serious player in the cryptocurrency market. Known for its vibrant community and social media presence, Dogecoin has garnered support from high-profile figures, including Elon Musk. Despite its meme origins, Dogecoin offers a simpler algorithm that facilitates quick and frequent transactions, making it popular for small-scale transfers and tipping online. \n \n \n \n3. Tron (TRX): The Blockchain for Digital Entertainment \n \n \n \nTron is a blockchain-based platform focused on decentralizing the internet and revolutionizing the digital entertainment industry. Its primary goal is to enable content creators to have direct control over their work, eliminating intermediaries and reducing costs. Tron’s high throughput and scalability make it an attractive option for developers looking to build decentralized applications (dApps). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4. Chainlink (LINK): The Oracle Network Powerhouse \n \n \n \nChainlink is a decentralized oracle network that enables smart contracts on various blockchains to securely interact with external data feeds, APIs, and payment systems. This functionality is crucial for the development of complex smart contracts that require real-world data to execute. Chainlink’s secure and reliable data oracles have made it a critical infrastructure component in the DeFi ecosystem. \n \n \n \nThe increasing adoption of DeFi platforms and the growing demand for secure and reliable data feeds have driven Chainlink’s growth.

				"content": "Amid the current Bitcoin market performance suggesting signs of a rebound, prominent crypto analyst Wise Advice has highlighted a critical indicator in Bitcoin’s trading pattern. \nBollinger Bands Signal 200% Bitcoin Surge \nAccording to the analyst, the Bitcoin weekly Bollinger Band, a statistical chart characterizing the prices and volatility over time, has shrunk to its second-lowest width in six years. Traditionally, such contraction has been a precursor to substantial price movements. \n \nWise advice disclosed that historically, a similar constriction was observed before Bitcoin surged 200% from a base of $24,000 to a high peak within five months. This indicator is particularly noteworthy as it suggests that market volatility is about to increase, potentially leading to a significant price rise. \nFor context, Bollinger Bands are a set of trend indicators derived from a moving average and an upper and lower band, each set at a standard deviation from the moving average. This tool helps traders to assess how high or low the current price is relative to previous trades. \nA narrowing of these bands typically indicates a reduction in volatility. A sharp increase or decrease often follows it in price, as the market prepares to make a substantial move. \n \nBitcoin Holders, Read this  \nThe #Bitcoin weekly Bollinger band is now at its 2nd lowest level in 6 years. \nThe last time it was this low, #BTC was trading at $24K, and it pumped 200% in just 5 months pic.twitter.com/jnud3pCjAr \n— Wise Advice (@wiseadvicesumit) July 1, 2024 \nRecent Market Activity and Bullish Outlook \nDespite a promising setup, Bitcoin has recently struggled to maintain its upward momentum. Over the past week, while there has been a modest 3% recovery, the price has faced resistance, peaking at $63,790 before dipping to around $62,563. \n \nThis recent price action occurs amid broader market anticipation of a favorable July. Market analysts, including the team at QCP Capital, reference historical data showing Bitcoin’s tendency to rebound in July with an average return of 9.6%, especially after weak performances in June. \nThis pattern of a strong July following a weak June is supported by additional market commentary. They are not alone in their optimism; other market analysts like Ali have also noted similar recovery patterns in past post-June slumps, hinting at a strong comeback in July. \nSupporting the bullish sentiment are the substantial inflows into US spot Bitcoin ETFs. This Monday, these funds recorded daily net inflows totaling $129.45 million, marking the fifth consecutive day of positive flows and the most substantial intake since early June. \n \nLeading the inflows were Fidelity’s FBTC and Bitwise’s BITB, with significant contributions, suggesting that institutional interest remains strong despite the market’s recent fluctuations. \nFeatured image created with DALL-E, Chart from TradingView",

According to the outlet, the arrangement puts Apple on equal footing with OpenAI's biggest backer, Microsoft, raising new questions about how the competitors will coexist on OpenAI's board.Details of the new arrangement follow Apple's announcement last month that it would integrate OpenAI's ChatGPT with future devices as part of a larger AI push at the tech company. Users who prefer not to use ChatGT will be able to opt-out of the features, Business Insider previously reported.Phil Schiller, head of Apple's app store and former marketing chief, was picked for the board position, Bloomberg reported. Schiller will serve in an observer role, meaning he won't have voting powers, but he will be able to sit in on OpenAI meetings, giving Apple key insight into the inner workings of the AI company, according to the outlet.Neither Apple nor OpenAI immediately responded to a request for comment from Business Insider.\"This would be a smart move for Cupertino given how important OpenAI is to the broader AI vision in Apple,\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told Business Insider.The arrangement, the details of which are still in flux, is set to start later this year, and Schiller has not attended any meetings yet, according to the Bloomberg report.Microsoft has long been OpenAI's largest backer and a key business partner, having invested billions of dollars into the AI company. Ahead of the Apple-OpenAI integration announcement, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella met with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman to discuss concerns about the forthcoming Apple deal, The Information reported in May.However, the Apple-OpenAI partnership could ultimately benefit Microsoft, too, Venture Beat reported last month. The deal could offer Microsoft Trojan horse-like insight into Apple, one of its key competitors, and pave the way for friendlier relationships between the two rivals.It is not uncommon for board observers to leave meetings where sensitive information is being discussed — something Microsoft could ask Apple to do or vice versa, Bloomberg reported.The Apple partnership marked a massive win for OpenAI, coming at a key time for Altman after mounting scandals at the company, including a company coup, growing concerns about safe AI, and a brush-up with Scarlett Johansson over the use of her likeness.Read the original article on Business Insider",

It seeks to bring NFTs to mainstream usage in a superchain, providing a reliable architecture for NFTs. The introduction of IceCreamSwap into this ecosystem is expected to avail users with improved trading functionality using AI technology. \n \n \n \nSome essential elements of the Mint Blockchain ecosystem are ZAN, which has been included as the designated RPC supplier, and NFTScan as the official on-chain NFT browser. Moreover, several NFT marketplaces exist in this ecosystem, all powered by Supra Oracle to enhance decision-making for dApps. \n \n \n \nOne of the distinctive elements of IceCreamSwap is the functionality of the AI DEX Aggregator that is launched for Mint Blockchain now. The integration of these two concepts presents several important benefits. First, the AI-powered DEX Aggregator means that users can swap tokens at the rates that are available on every DEX and optimise every trade. \n \n \n \nSecondly, the platform creates opportunities for arbitrage, thus representing opportunities for users to profit from discrepancies instead of being exploited by arbitrage bots. This results in better execution prices and lower price effects to make trades more efficient and profitable. \n \n \n \nIn addition, users can offer liquidity in IceCreamSwap, which has advantages like receiving trading fees with no deposit and withdrawal fees or time lock. This feature increases the platform’s appeal to liquidity providers. \n \n \n \nIceCreamSwap Ensures Security with Audited Contracts \n \n \n \nNotably, all the trading contracts in IceCreamSwap are safe and secure because the decentralised platform is security audited. This makes the customers to feel safe to engage in trading because the platform is safe, reliable and secure. \n \n \n \nThe launch of IceCreamSwap on the Mint Blockchain is a groundbreaking improvement in numerous aspects of decentralized trading and NFT. IceCreamSwap provides a better trading experience that is more convenient, cheaper and safer by implementing latest artificial intelligent technology. This new launch of IceCreamSwap on Mint Blockchain underscores the growing potential of the Mint Blockchain ecosystem in the realm of NFTs and decentralized finance.",

Features  Easy to Use: Instead of manually copying and pasting from chatGPT to IDE, you can launch Cowboy with a single command and it will generate tests for your entire repo Coverage Guided Test Generation: We have a client component that runs your test suite locally to feed test coverage data to Cowboy's backend, so that every test generated is guranteed to improve coverage  Current Limitations: Cowboy only supports augmenting repos with existing unit tests, so greenfield projects without any unit test coverage are currently not going to work. Also, we currently only support Python code repos. Would love for you all to try it out and give me some feedback. Cheers!    submitted by    /u/dashasketaminedealer   [link]   [comments]",

				"content": "Over the last 24 hours, the Ethereum price has seen a minor 1.03% loss amid broader market growth.  \nDespite this recent developments pose the potential to push Ethereum out of its recent rut.  \nThis comes as other major cryptocurrencies are seeing renewed growth following the stir generated by recent Bitcoin wallet movements relating to Mt Gox. \nThe Ethereum price is seemingly at a standstill. Although ETH has seen a 2.49% increase since last Tuesday, it has done little to recover from its recent losses, standing at 9.16% over the past month. \nIt seems that Ethereum is no longer reveling in the hype surrounding the SEC approval of Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) last month.  \nInvestment firms are waiting on the SEC’s greenlight to begin trading them, with no updates outside of SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s statement that the progress of launching the first Ether ETFs is “going smoothly.” \nA premise that is reflected in Ethereum’s trading volume, which has decreased 7.85% to $10.18 billion over the past 24 hours. \nGiven this, traders are looking to other fundamentals for an indicator of where Ethereum is headed next.  \nVitalik Buterin’s Proposal \nVitalik Buterin suggested new methods to accelerate transaction confirmation times on the Ethereum network In a recent blog post. \nHe outlined a novel approach where each block is finalized before the next one is created, aiming to significantly enhance transaction speed and user experience. \nHistorically, Ethereum has lagged behind other blockchains in transaction speeds. They have improved to 5-20 seconds following the Merge, but other chains are still twice as fast.  \nA May 2024 CoinGecko report highlighted Ethereum’s absence from the top 10 fastest blockchains, with Solana, SUI, and Binance Smart Chain leading in speed. \nTo address this, Buterin proposes a method called single-slot finality, which would greatly reduce the current 12.8-minute transaction finalization time under Ethereum’s Gasper consensus. \nButerin also advocates for using layer 2 solutions, or rollups, which process transactions faster by utilizing smaller groups of validators.  \nAnother proposal from Buterin involves allowing users to pay additional fees for immediate transaction confirmations. This system, known as fee-based confirmations, would enable Ethereum proposers to guarantee transaction inclusion in the next block. \nButerin believes these changes are feasible, but they remain conceptual at this stage. No details about implementation or timelines have been provided yet. \nThe need for improved transaction speed is critical as the market anticipates the approval of Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, with investors closely watching the cryptocurrency’s competitive stance. \n“Over the last couple of years, we’ve become more and more uncomfortable with the current approach […] 12.8 minutes is way too long, and nobody cares to wait that long.” \nEthereum Price Prediction – Breakout Soon? \n \nWith significant news building around Ethereum, sentiment may be the push it needs to break through its recent stagnation. The last week may allude to a potential break higher. \n \nMost notably, the Ethereum price seems to be forming an ascending triangle pattern (white). It has been converging to a point, up towards the $3524.35 resistance level, guided by a positive trendline that has formed strong support over the past 9 days.  \nThis suggests strengthening bullish momentum as Ethereum continues to make higher lows.  \nCurrently, the altcoin is retesting this support. A decisive bounce upwards could confirm the strength of the pattern and position it for a retest of the resistance. \nHowever, the breakout from the pattern may not be on this attempt as wider trends air on bearishness.  \nNotably, The 30-day moving average (yellow) is now trending downwards towards the 200-day moving average (blue), which is also trending downwards. This reflects negative market sentiment, as both short-term and long-term trends are pointing downwards. \nThis is likely credited to the fact that both the proposed Ethereum upgraded and ETFs are yet to have clear implementation timelines – therefore there is still some uncertainty. \nLow-Cap Meme Coin With Higher Gains Potential \n \nWhile Ethereum certainly presents some upside potential, its $409B market cap limits its potential for truly substantial gains.  \nTherefore, more strategic traders may discover more promising opportunities by exploring newer low-cap meme coins ready for explosive growth \nEnter PlayDoge ($PLAY), the latest meme coin capturing the attention of meme fans, gamers, and crypto enthusiasts. \n \nIntroducing #PlayDoge – the only #P2E Doge companion!   \nInspired by the legacy of #Tamagotchi, feed, train and play with your 2D Doge to earn $PLAY.  \nDon't neglect your doge, his life's on the line   \nJoin the #Presale Now https://t.co/JT0VEofqf2 pic.twitter.com/RoJYXLS1FH \n— PlayDoge (@PlayDogeGame) June 3, 2024 \n \nThe meme coin market is over-saturated with Shiba Inu-themed coins boasting little to no real utility. In contrast, PlayDoge stands out by focusing on gaming utility. \nIt transforms the iconic Doge meme into a play-to-earn Tamagotchi-style virtual pet, tapping into 90s nostalgia.

Odds are also rising for Vice President Kamala Harris to replace Biden as the Democratic Party nominee. \nYet even without a Trump victory, Novogratz says attitudes on crypto are changing from within the Democratic Party. \n“Most Democrats – outside of Elizabeth Warren and a small group of people – are pretty pro-innovation and pro-crypto,” he said. \nThe House of Representatives passed multiple pieces of pro-crypto legislation in May, including the FIT21 ACT, a comprehensive bill to provide a clear regulatory framework for crypto firms to operate within the country. The bill received overwhelming bipartisan support, with 208 Republicans and 71 Democrats voting in favor. \nWhere Is Bitcoin’s Bull Market? \n \nThe CEO also commented on Bitcoin’s price stagnancy during the second quarter, acknowledging that its Q1 surge will take a while to “digest.” Nevertheless, exuberant government spending under both Trump and Biden will continue driving up asset prices. \n“These have been the two worst presidents in terms of increasing debt in the history of our country,” said Novogratz. “Until the government actually stops spending like drunken sailors… Bitcoin as a core holding makes all the sense in the world to me.” \nGalaxy Digital (GLXY) shares have risen 14.95% over the past five trading days. \nThe post Crypto Will Get Positive Legislation No Matter Who Wins Election, Says Mike Novogratz appeared first on Cryptonews.",

The Associated Press reports: Meta's updated privacy policy enables the company to feed people's public posts into its AI systems. That practice will not be permitted in Brazil, however. The decision stems from \"the imminent risk of serious and irreparable or difficult-to-repair damage to the fundamental rights of the affected data subjects,\" the agency said in the nation's official gazette. [...] Hye Jung Han, a Brazil-based researcher for the rights group, said in an email Tuesday that the regulator's action \"helps to protect children from worrying that their personal data, shared with friends and family on Meta's platforms, might be used to inflict harm back on them in ways that are impossible to anticipate or guard against.\"  \n   \nBut the decision regarding Meta will \"very likely\" encourage other companies to refrain from being transparent in the use of data in the future, said Ronaldo Lemos, of the Institute of Technology and Society of Rio de Janeiro, a think-tank. \"Meta was severely punished for being the only one among the Big Tech companies to clearly and in advance notify in its privacy policy that it would use data from its platforms to train artificial intelligence,\" he said. Compliance must be demonstrated by the company within five working days from the notification of the decision, and the agency established a daily fine of 50,000 reais ($8,820) for failure to do so. In a statement, Meta said the company is \"disappointed\" by the decision and insists its method \"complies with privacy laws and regulations in Brazil.\"  \n   \n\"This is a step backwards for innovation, competition in AI development and further delays bringing the benefits of AI to people in Brazil,\" a spokesperson for the company added.  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nRead more of this story at Slashdot.",

				"content": " \nConcept-based learning (CBL) in machine learning emphasizes using high-level concepts from raw features for predictions, enhancing model interpretability and efficiency. A prominent type, the concept-based bottleneck model (CBM), compresses input features into a low-dimensional space to capture essential data while discarding non-essential information. This process enhances explainability in tasks like image and speech recognition. However, CBMs often require deep neural networks and extensive labeled data. A simpler approach involves Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), which labels groups of data (bags) with unknown individual labels. For instance, clustering image patches and assigning probabilities based on overall image labels can infer individual patch labels. \n \n \n \nGreat St. Petersburg Polytechnic University researchers have pioneered an approach to CBL known as Frequentist Inference CBL (FI-CBL). This method involves segmenting concept-labeled images into patches and encoding them into embeddings using an autoencoder. These embeddings are then clustered to identify groups corresponding to specific concepts. FI-CBL determines concept probabilities for new images by analyzing the frequency of patches associated with each concept value. Moreover, FI-CBL integrates expert knowledge through logical rules, which adjust concept probabilities accordingly. This approach stands out for its transparency, interpretability, and efficacy, particularly in scenarios with limited training data. \n \n \n \nCBL models, including CBMs, use high-level concepts for interpretable predictions. These models span various applications, from image recognition to tabular data analysis, and are pivotal in medicine. CBMs feature a two-module structure that separates the learning of concepts and their impact on the target variable. Innovations like concept embedding models and probabilistic CBMs have enhanced their interpretability and accuracy. Additionally, integrating expert knowledge into machine learning, particularly through logic rules, has garnered significant interest, with methods ranging from constraints in loss functions to mapping rules to neural network components. \n \n \n \nCBL involves a classifier predicting both target variables and concepts from a set of training data pairs. Each data pair includes an input feature vector, a target class, and binary concept values indicating the presence or absence of concepts. CBL models aim to predict and explain how these concepts relate to the predictions. This is typically done using a two-step function: mapping inputs to concepts and then concepts to forecasts. For instance, in medical images, each image can be divided into patches, and their embeddings can be clustered to determine concept probabilities, allowing the model to explain and highlight relevant areas in the images based on these concepts. \n \n \n \nIncorporating expert rules into the FI-CBL profoundly influences the probabilistic model by adjusting the concepts’ prior and conditional probabilities. By integrating logical expressions provided by experts, such as “IF Contour is <grainy>, THEN Diagnosis is <malignant>,” the model refines its predictions based on these constraints. This enhancement facilitates a more nuanced understanding of medical imaging data, where prior probabilities for diagnoses like <malignant> increase or decrease as per rule satisfaction, thus improving diagnostic accuracy and interpretability. Integrating expert rules empowers FI-CBL to blend domain expertise with statistical modeling effectively, advancing reliability and insightfulness in medical diagnostics. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe FI-CBL offers significant advantages over neural network-based CBMs in certain scenarios. FI-CBL is characterized by its transparency and interpretability, providing a clear sequence of calculations and explicit probabilistic interpretations of all model outputs. It demonstrates superior performance with small training datasets, leveraging robust statistical methods to enhance classification accuracy. However, FI-CBL’s effectiveness depends heavily on accurate clusterization and optimal patch size selection, posing challenges in scenarios with varied concept sizes. Despite these challenges, FI-CBL’s flexibility in architecture adjustments and ability to integrate expert rules effectively make it a promising approach for enhancing interpretability and performance in machine learning tasks. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCheck out the Paper.

				"content": "As the DeFi space continues to grow, security has emerged as a major stumbling block on the road to mainstream adoption. The space may have made strides in recent years to improve security and protect users' funds, but hacks and exploits remain a regular occurrence in the ecosystem.  \n\\  \nIn late April, Magpie Protocol suffered an attack that resulted in $129,000 value in USD from 221 wallets. I sat down with Ikram Ansari, Co-founder and CIO of Magpie, to get their perspective on the issue as well as Magpie’s experience and lessons learned from getting hacked.  \n\\  \nQ: How are DeFi protocols currently alerted about hacks? Does the hacker reach out to gloat? Are there systems in place to alert the team? Does the team wait for users to see if there’s something sketchy going on?  \n\\  \nThere are real-time monitoring and protection tools that continuously listen to blockchain events and alert teams of any smart contract issues. For example, Cube3AI allows protocols to implement real-time monitoring of their smart contracts. It works by assigning a score – safe, warning, or unsafe – to transactions executed on a contract.  \n\\  \nThese tools only monitor, though. So, it's up to the protocol to implement an automated pause or any action if an alert is triggered. Cube3AI also offers real-time protection and will block a transaction if triggered by an issue that doesn’t require manual intervention by the team members.  \n\\  \nOverall, if a project isn’t utilizing such a tool, it is up to the team to detect any anomalous activity by monitoring their smart contracts. Users will also generally let teams know when something needs looking into.  \n\\  \n Q: Magpie’s response was swift, and users appreciated that. What kind of impact has it had in the short term, and do you think it will continue to hurt the brand in the long term?  \n\\  \nMagpie had to temporarily take the dApp offline to fix the exploit. We had the newly updated code tested and verified and received positive feedback on our contracts from our auditor QuillAudits.  \n\\  \nIn the meantime, however, we had to stop our community campaigns. Spending around a month handling the situation also pushed back the date of the Token Generation Event (TGE) as we could not launch our token during or directly after the exploit.  \n\\  \nThis may have slowed our momentum in the short term, but we don’t believe it’ll hurt the brand in the long term as the response was swift, the exploited amount low (relative to other exploits), all users were reimbursed, and it all happened before the TGE and its accompanying promotions, campaigns, and PR.  \n\\  \nSo we actually think it will improve sentiment, as users will see that Magpie has a team dedicated to security and the community. We not only kept going but actively worked to make things better.  \n\\  \nQ: DeFi has reached the point where users shrug and say, “Hacks happen.” Some users are so used to it that they don’t even bat an eyelash anymore. What do you think of this desensitization? Was DeFi always doomed to this kind of mentality? What will it take to change it?  \n\\  \nDeFi’s adoption and technology are still in the early stages. Most of its users are also what some would call the more serious, or hardcore, crypto users, who may be more accustomed to the “wild-west” nature of DeFi in comparison to centralized finance, but that is not to say that hacks and rug-pulls are enjoyed or welcomed in any way.  \n\\  \nWe believe that the power users, at least at this time, have become de-sensitized to such hacks as a price for being early adopters of this technology.  \n\\  \nBut with advancements, such as smart contract wallets, account abstraction, and new security measures, the mentality will change as security is improved.  \n\\  \nQ: Your transparency and the efforts you’re making moving forward are commendable. Can you explain in detail how Cube3AI will help secure your project and how it works?  \n\\  \nCube3AI helps our efforts to secure Magpie Protocol by offering real-time protection. This is done by two kinds of products: Detect and Protect.  \n\\  \nThe Detect suite provides detailed risk scoring for blockchain addresses, assesses cyber threats, fraud, and compliance issues, monitors transactions in real-time on any blockchain, and delivers instant risk scores for new smart contracts across multiple mainnets.  \n\\  \nThe Protect suite features RASP (Runtime Application Self-Protection), which integrates with smart contracts to provide real-time risk scoring and can revert transactions if security risks are detected.  \n\\  \nWe currently use Cube3AI for monitoring. Every transaction executed on our contract is given a score, and any issue triggers an alert on Slack. In the next Magpie version, we plan to integrate Cube3AI RASP into our backend, enabling us to receive real-time feedback on transactions before they are executed.  \n\\  \nQ: Do you think prioritizing convenience for your users could have had something to do with the vulnerability? Sometimes it seems like the easier things are for users, the more likely a project will be exploited.  \n\\  \nIn our case, the vulnerability was not due to simplifying the process for users. Prioritizing convenience for users can sometimes lead to vulnerabilities because simplifying processes may involve reducing security measures. Balancing usability and security is essential to protect against potential threats without overly complicating the user experience.  \n\\n ",

				"content": "Ever say \"please\" and \"thank you\" to your AI assistant? It turns out, politeness matters! This article explores how the way we talk to large language models (LLMs) affects their responses. Learn how being polite can lead to better results and uncover the fascinating link between AI and human social behavior. \n\\ \nIn the age of digital communication and AI, the nuances of human interaction are evolving in fascinating ways. One aspect that stands out is the role of politeness when engaging with large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Google Gemini. As a frequent user of these advanced AI assistants, I've noticed my natural inclination to say \"please\" and \"thank you\" in my requests. This habit made me ponder whether these courtesies impact the quality of AI-generated responses and the overall interaction experience. \n\\ \nTo delve deeper, I asked ChatGPT and Gemini directly about their preferences regarding human politeness. Both LLMs responded that while politeness does not alter their computational processes, it significantly enhances the quality of human-LLM interactions, leading to fewer biases and greater user satisfaction. \n\\ \n  \n\\ \n\\ \nIntrigued by these responses, I embarked on a small experiment to see if the tone of inquiries—polite, neutral, or impolite—would influence the quality of AI-generated results. Using different user accounts, I posed questions about Hackernoon to both ChatGPT and Gemini, carefully varying the politeness of my tone. \n\\ \nThe results were telling and underscored human politeness's subtle yet impactful role in our interactions with AI. \n\\ \nExperiment Results \n\\ \nChatGPT4o Replies \n\\ \n  \n\\ \n\\ \n\\ \n \nNeutral query: Generates a neutral response. \nPolite query: Generates a detailed response. \nImpolite queries: Generate neutral responses. \n \n\\ \nGemini Replies \n\\ \n\\ \n  \n\\ \n \nNeutral query: Generates a response with active links to Hackernoon. However, it may contain potential bias, as the statement about Hackernoon criticism dates back to 2019 and I haven’t found any recent criticism within the first three pages of Google’s search results. As of this writing, Hackernoon has a score of 3.9 on Trustpilot which equates to 4 stars and falls into the “great” range. \nPolite query: Generates a neutral response without embedded URLs. \nImpolite queries: Responses varied, one including potential bias and another containing an apologetic statement despite being a new query. \n \n\\ \nDuring my further exploration of available LLM research papers, I came across a thought-provoking study by Hao Wang et al. on the influence of prompt politeness on LLM performance. Assuming LLMs mirror human communication traits, Waseda University researchers assessed politeness's impact across English, Chinese, and Japanese tasks. \n\\ \nThey posed a fundamental question: Does the phrasing of our requests to sophisticated models like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Meta's LLaMA affect response quality? \n\\ \n \n  In human interactions, politeness often garners more favorable reactions, while rudeness can lead to aversion and conflict. Would LLMs exhibit similar behaviors? \n \n\\ \nTo explore this, the team designed experiments across three languages, crafting eight levels of politeness for prompts in each language, from highly polite to rudely brusque. Their goal was to observe how these varying levels of politeness impacted the models' performance in summarization, language understanding, and bias detection tasks. \n\\ \nGeneral Study Observations \n\\ \n \nMirror of Human Traits: LLMs reflect human communication traits and align with cultural norms, suggesting that they respond similarly to humans when exposed to varying levels of politeness. \nImpact of Impoliteness: Impolite prompts often degrade performance, whereas excessive politeness does not consistently enhance it. \n \nLanguage-Specific Insights \n \nEnglish: \nPerformance metrics like ROUGE-L and BERTScore remained stable irrespective of the politeness level. \nThe length of generated output decreased with higher politeness, but extremely impolite prompts resulted in longer outputs for models like GPT-3.5 and Llama2-70B. \nChinese: \nModels summarized content accurately, with output length decreasing as politeness decreased. However, extremely rude prompts led to longer outputs for GPT-3.5, while GPT-4's outputs became shorter. \nChatGLM3 exhibited stable output lengths across moderate politeness levels, hinting at unique cultural communication preferences. \nJapanese: \nSimilar trends were observed, like in English and Chinese, but with unique length variations. The output length decreased with moderate politeness and rose significantly with extreme rudeness. \nPoliteness system intricacies in Japanese culture influenced these variations, reflecting a deeply embedded respect hierarchy. \n \nLanguage Understanding Benchmark \n \nEnglish: \nGPT-3.5 performed best with very polite prompts, while GPT-4 maintained stable performance across all politeness levels. \nLlama2-70B showed noticeable sensitivity to prompt politeness, performing better with higher politeness levels. \nChinese: \nPolite prompts generally yielded better scores, but excessive politeness reduced performance. ChatGLM3's scores declined steadily from high to low politeness. \nJapanese: \nLower politeness levels generally resulted in better scores, except at extreme levels. Swallow-70B excelled with moderate politeness levels, reflecting common examination expressions. \n \nStereotypical Bias Detection \n \nEnglish: \nGPT-3.5 exhibited high bias with moderate politeness. GPT-4 demonstrated low bias, particularly at moderate politeness levels. Llama2-70B showed low bias but tended to refuse to answer impolite prompts. \nChinese: \nBias decreased with increasing politeness but spiked with very low politeness. GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 followed similar trends, with ChatGLM3 being more sensitive to politeness changes. \nJapanese: \nGender bias varied significantly, with the lowest levels at moderate politeness for GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Swallow-70B displayed high bias with significant fluctuation influenced by Japanese cultural norms. \n \nInfluence of RLHF and SFT \n \nEnhancing Performance and Reducing Bias: Reinforce Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) improved model performance and mitigated bias. \nLlama2-70 B's Performance: The model exhibited less bias than its base version, confirming the efficacy of RLHF and SFT. Bias trends in base models suggested that these techniques primarily governed the impact of the politeness level. \n \n\\ \nThe study concludes that prompt politeness significantly affects LLM performance, mirroring human social behavior. Impolite prompts often resulted in increased bias and incorrect or refused answers. While moderate politeness generally yielded better results, the standard of moderation varied by language. \n\\ \n\\ \n \n  This phenomenon underscores the importance of considering cultural backgrounds in LLM development and corpus collection. \n \n\\ \nBottom Line \nExploring politeness in LLM interactions reveals a fascinating intersection between human social behavior and artificial intelligence. As we continue integrating LLMs into various aspects of our lives, understanding how our communication style impacts their performance becomes increasingly important. This study underscores that, much like in human interactions, politeness can lead to more favorable outcomes when engaging with LLMs. As we move forward, acknowledging cultural nuances and refining our communication with these models will maximize their potential and ensure more accurate and unbiased AI-generated responses. \n\\ \nDon't miss out on AI's Dirty Secret: Discover Now!",

				"content": " \nLido Analytics reported a 1.36% increase in Total Value Locked (TVL), reaching $33.48 billion. This growth was primarily driven by a net addition of 95,616 ETH staked through Lido, highlighting continued confidence in the platform’s staking services. The 7-day Annual Percentage Rate (APR) for stETH experienced a minor decrease, falling by 0.04% to 2.96%. Despite this slight dip, Lido continues to attract substantial new deposits, underscoring the platform’s appeal to stakers seeking reliable returns. \n \n \n \n \n📊 Lido Analytics: June 24 – July 1, 2024TLDR:– TVL up 1.36% to $33.48b.– 95,616 net new ETH staked through Lido.– 7d stETH APR at 2.96%.– wstETH on L2 up 7.19% to 141,586 wstETH.– (w)stETH 7d trading volume at $1.23b.👇— Lido (@LidoFinance) July 2, 2024 \n \n \n \n \nLido’s wrapped stETH (wstETH) on Layer 2 networks rose significantly by 7.19%, totalling 141,586 wstETH. Notable movements within these networks included a substantial increase in Scroll, which surged by 86.26% to 21,181 wstETH. The Base network also grew by 1.55% to 14,895 wstETH. However, minor decreases on Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, Linea, and zkSync Era reflected the dynamic nature of staking across different platforms. \n \n \n \nIncrease in stETH in DeFi and Cosmos \n \n \n \nThe amount of (w)stETH in DeFi lending pools saw a slight increase of 0.63%, reaching 2.70 million stETH. Similarly, (w)stETH in liquidity pools rose by 0.62%, totalling 83.5k stETH. On the Cosmos network, wstETH experienced a modest increase of 2.12%, bringing the total to 1,788 wstETH. These figures highlight the growing integration and utilisation of stETH across various DeFi ecosystems and networks. \n \n \n \nDespite the overall positive metrics, the 7-day trading volume for (w)stETH recorded a 7.25% decrease, totalling $1.23 billion for the week. This drop in trading volume suggests a temporary slowdown in trading activity, though it remains within a healthy range considering the overall market conditions. \n \n \n \nThese updates reflect Lido’s continued growth and resilience in the staking and DeFi space. While some metrics showed minor fluctuations, the overall trend indicates strong performance and increasing adoption of Lido’s staking solutions.",

				"content": "Sentient, an ambitious open-source artificial intelligence (AI) development platform, has secured a substantial $85 million in seed funding. The round was co-led by Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, Pantera Capital, and Framework Ventures, with participation from numerous other high-profile investors including Robot Ventures, Delphi, and Arrington Capital.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe platform aims to address growing concerns about the concentration of AI power in the hands of a few tech giants by creating an open ecosystem where developers can monetize their open-source models and data. Sentient’s approach is reminiscent of the 1995 closed-source software landscape, with the goal of decentralizing AI development and ensuring more equitable distribution of its benefits.  \n  \n  \n  \nBehind Sentient are notable figures including Sandeep Nailwal, co-founder of Polygon; Pramod Viswanath, Princeton professor and co-inventor of 4G wireless technology; and Himanshu Tyagi, a professor at the Indian Institute of Science. The platform will be built on Polygon, representing an expansion of the Ethereum scaler into the AI space.  \n  \n  \n  \nJoey Krug, partner at Founders Fund, highlighted the platform’s potential to solve the incentive problem in open-source AI development. Currently, AI models can be copied without compensation, which discourages open-source contributions. Sentient aims to establish a new form of property rights in AI, ensuring that developers are rewarded for their work.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe funds will be used to hire AI research and blockchain engineering experts, develop Sentient’s platform, and establish partnerships with leading academic institutions and industry players. The platform plans to launch its testnet in the third quarter of 2024, marking a significant step towards its vision of community-built open artificial general intelligence (AGI).  \n  \n  \n  \nSentient’s approach involves launching “campaigns” for contributors, with specific metrics for evaluating contributions and rewards. These rewards may include co-ownership of the AI models created and future rewards based on their usage. While there are no immediate plans for a token, the project leaves room for future decisions as the community grows.  \nThe post Sentient Raises $85M in Seed Funding to Democratize AI Development appeared first on FinTech Ranking.",

By leveraging Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), GHO is not just another stablecoin; it transforms into a pivotal asset within the Aave ecosystem on Arbitrum, enhancing its utility and reach.  \n \n \n \nThis integration allows users on Arbitrum to borrow GHO, adding a robust layer of functionality and encouraging wider adoption of the stablecoin in DeFi activities. \n \n \n \nThe technological underpinning of GHO’s stability and security across different blockchains is ingeniously designed through a lock-and-mint model facilitated by CCIP. This mechanism ensures that each GHO token minted on platforms like Arbitrum is backed by an equivalent amount locked on the Ethereum mainnet, maintaining stringent checks on the total supply.  \n \n \n \nSuch a model not only safeguards the token’s stability but also bolsters its credibility and reliability as a decentralized financial instrument. \n \n \n \nCommunity-Driven Expansion \n \n \n \nThe expansion of GHO to additional networks is guided by the Aave community through proposals and decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) voting processes. This community-driven approach reflects Aave’s commitment to fostering a stablecoin that is not only decentralized and overcollateralized but also adaptable to meet the evolving needs of its users across various networks.  \n \n \n \nThe DAO’s involvement ensures that each step of GHO’s expansion is aligned with user interests and market demands, paving the way for a genuinely decentralized financial future. \n \n \n \nBy integrating GHO into Arbitrum, Aave not only diversifies its stablecoin’s applications but also taps into a thriving ecosystem that could significantly enhance the stablecoin’s usage and liquidity.  \n \n \n \nThis strategic move is expected to attract more users and developers to both Aave and Arbitrum, potentially increasing transaction volumes and solidifying both platforms’ positions in the competitive DeFi landscape. Moreover, it sets a precedent for future expansions, indicating Aave’s long-term vision for GHO as a cross-chain capable stablecoin.",

				"content": "When the Jaccard similarity index isn’t the right tool for the job, and what to do insteadI’ve been thinking lately about one of my go-to data science tools, something we use quite a bit at Aampe: the Jaccard index. It’s a similarity metric that you compute by taking the size of the intersection of two sets and dividing it by the size of the union of two sets. In essence, it’s a measure of overlap.For my fellow visual learners:Image by authorMany (myself included) have sung the praises of the Jaccard index because it comes in handy for a lot of use cases where you need to figure out the similarity between two groups of elements. Whether you’ve got a relatively concrete use case like cross-device identity resolution, or something more abstract, like characterize latent user interest categories based on historical user behavior — it’s really helpful to have a tool that quantifies how many components two things share.But Jaccard is not a silver bullet. Sometimes it’s more informative when it’s used along with other metrics than when it’s used alone. Sometimes it’s downright misleading.Let’s take a closer look at a few cases when it’s not quite appropriate, and what you might want to do instead (or alongside).Your sets are of very different sizesThe problem: The bigger one set is than the other (holding the size of the intersection equal), the more it depresses the Jaccard index.In some cases, you don’t care if two sets are reciprocally similar. Maybe you just want to know if Set A mostly intersects with Set B.Let’s say you’re trying to figure a taxonomy of user interest based on browsing history. You have a log of all the users who visited http://www.luxurygoodsemporium.com and a log of all the users who visited http://superexpensiveyachts.com (neither of which are live links at press time; fingers crossed no one creepy buys these domains in the future).Say that out of 1,000 users who browsed for super expensive yachts, 900 of them also looked up some luxury goods — but 50,000 users visited the luxury goods site. Intuitively, you might interpret these two domains as similar. Nearly everyone who patronized the yacht domain also went to the luxury goods domain. Seems like we might be detecting a latent dimension of “high-end purchase behavior.”But because the number of users who were into yachts was so much smaller than the number of users who were into luxury goods, the Jaccard index would end up being very small (0.018) even though the vast majority of the yacht-shoppers also browsed luxury goods!What to do instead: Use the overlap coefficient.The overlap coefficient is the size of the intersection of two sets divided by the size of the smaller set. Formally:Let’s visualize why this might be preferable to Jaccard in some cases, using the most extreme version of the problem: Set A is a subset of Set B.When Set B is pretty close in size to Set B, you’ve got a decent Jaccard similarity, because the size of the intersection (which is the size of Set A) is close to the size of the union. But as you hold the size of Set A constant and increase the size of Set B, the size of the union increases too, and…the Jaccard index plummets.The overlap coefficient does not. It stays yoked to the size of the smallest set. That means that even as the size of Set B increases, the size of the intersection (which in this case is the whole size of Set A) will always be divided by the size of Set A.Image by authorLet’s go back to our user interest taxonomy example. The overlap coefficient is capturing what we’re interested in here — the user base for yacht-buying is connected to the luxury goods user base. Maybe the SEO for the yacht website is no good, and that’s why it’s not patronized as much as the luxury goods site. With the overlap coefficient, you don’t have to worry about something like that obscuring the relationship between those domains.Pro tip: if all you have are the sizes of each set and the size of the intersection, you can find the size of the union by summing the sizes of each set and subtracting the size of the intersection. Like this:Further reading: https://medium.com/rapids-ai/similarity-in-graphs-jaccard-versus-the-overlap-coefficient-610e083b877dYour sets are smallThe problem: When set sizes are very small, your Jaccard index is lower-resolution, and sometimes that overemphasizes relationships between sets.Let’s say you work at a start-up that produces mobile games, and you’re developing a recommender system that suggests new games to users based on their previous playing habits. You’ve got two new games out: Mecha-Crusaders of the Cyber Void II: Prisoners of Vengeance, and Freecell.A focus group probably wouldn’t peg these two as being very similar, but your analysis shows a Jaccard similarity of .4. No great shakes, but it happens to be on the higher end of the other pairwise Jaccards you’re seeing — after all, Bubble Crush and Bubble Exploder only have a Jaccard similarity of .39. Does this mean your cyberpunk RPG and Freecell are more closely related (as far as your recommender is concerned) than Bubble Crush and Bubble Exploder?Not necessarily. Because you took a closer look at your data, and only 3 unique device IDs have been logged playing Mecha-Crusaders, only 4 have been logged playing Freecell, and 2 of them just happened to have played both. Whereas Bubble Crush and Bubble Exploder were each visited by hundreds of devices. Because your samples for the two new games are so small, a possibly coincidental overlap makes the Jaccard similarity look much bigger than the true population overlap would probably be.Image by authorWhat to do instead: Good data hygiene is always something to keep in mind here — you can set a heuristic to wait until you’ve collected a certain sample size to consider a set in your similarity matrix. Like all estimates of statistical power, there’s an element of judgment to this, based on the typical size of the sets you’re working with, but bear in mind the general statistical best practice that larger samples tend to be more representative of their populations.But another option you have is to log-transform the size of the intersection and the size of the union. This output should only be interpreted when comparing two modified indices to each other.If you do this for the example above, you get a score pretty close to what you had before for the two new games (0.431). But since you have so many more observations in the Bubble genre of games, the log-transformed intersection and log-transformed union are a lot closer together — which translates to a much higher score.Caveat: The trade-off here is that you lose some resolution when the union has a lot of elements in it. Adding a hundred elements to the intersection of a union with thousands of elements could mean the difference between a regular Jaccard score of .94 and .99. Using the log transform approach might mean that adding a hundred elements to the intersection only moves the needle from a score of .998 to .999. It depends on what’s important to your use case!The frequency of elements mattersThe problem: You’re comparing two groups of elements, but collapsing the elements into sets results in a loss of signal.This is why using a Jaccard index to compare two pieces of text is not always a great idea. It can be tempting to look at a pair of documents and want to get a measure of their similarity based on what tokens are shared between them. But the Jaccard index assumes that the elements in the two groups to be compared are unique. Which flattens out word frequency. And in natural language analysis, token frequency is often really important.Imagine you’re comparing a book about vegetable gardening, the Bible, and a dissertation about the life cycle of the white-tailed deer. All three of these documents might include the token “deer,” but the relative frequency of the “deer” token will vary dramatically between the documents. The much higher frequency of the word “deer” in the dissertation probably has a different semantic impact than the scarce uses of the word “deer” in the other documents. You wouldn’t want a similarity measure to just forget about that signal.What to do instead: Use cosine similarity. It’s not just for NLP anymore! (But also it’s for NLP.)Briefly, cosine similarity is a way to measure how similar two vectors are in multidimensional space (irrespective of the magnitude of the vectors). The direction a vector goes in multidimensional space depends on the frequencies of the dimensions that are used to define the space, so information about frequency is baked in.To make it easy to visualize, let’s say there are only two tokens we care about across the three documents: “deer” and “bread.” Each text uses these tokens a different number of times. The frequency of these tokens become the dimensions that we plot the three texts in, and the texts are represented as vectors on this two-dimensional plane. For instance, the vegetable gardening book mentions deer 3 times and bread 5 times, so we plot a line from the origin to (3, 5).Image by authorHere you want to look at the angles between the vectors. θ1 represents the similarity between the dissertation and the Bible; θ2, the similarity between the dissertation and the vegetable gardening book; and θ3, the similarity between the Bible and the vegetable gardening book.The angles between the dissertation and either of the other texts is pretty large. We take that to mean that the dissertation is semantically distant from the other two — at least relatively speaking. The angle between the Bible and the gardening book is small relative to each of their angles with the dissertation, so we’d take that to mean there’s less semantic distance between the two of them than from the dissertation.But we’re talking here about similarity, not distance. Cosine similarity is a transformation of the angle measurement of the two vectors into an index that goes from 0 to 1*, with the same intuitive pattern as Jaccard — 0 would mean two groups have nothing in common, and closer you get to 1 the more similar the two groups are.* Technically, cosine similarity can go from -1 to 1, but we’re using it with frequencies here, and there can be no frequencies less than zero. So we’re limited to the interval of 0 to 1.Cosine similarity is famously applied to text analysis, like we’ve done above, but it can be generalized to other use cases where frequency is important. Let’s return to the luxury goods and yachts use case. Suppose you don’t merely have a log of which unique users went to each site, you also have the counts of number of times the user visited. Maybe you find that each of the 900 users who went to both websites only went to the luxury goods site once or twice, whereas they went to their yacht website dozens of times. If we think of each user as a token, and therefore as a different dimension in multidimensional space, a cosine similarity approach might push the yacht-heads a little further away from the luxury good patrons. (Note that you can run into scalability issues here, depending on the number of users you’re considering.)Further reading: https://medium.com/geekculture/cosine-similarity-and-cosine-distance-48eed889a5c4Parting thoughtsI still love the Jaccard index. It’s simple to compute and generally pretty intuitive, and I end up using it all the time. So why write a whole blog post dunking on it?Because no one data science tool can give you a complete picture of your data. Each of these different measures tell you something slightly different. You can get valuable information out of seeing where the outputs of these tools converge and where they differ, as long as you know what the tools are actually telling you.Philosophically, we’re against one-size-fits-all approaches at Aampe. After all the time we’ve spent looking at what makes users unique, we’ve realized the value of leaning into complexity. So we think the wider the array of tools you can use, the better — as long as you know how to use them.You Kon’t Know Jacc(ard) was originally published in Towards Data Science on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.",
